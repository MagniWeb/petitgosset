    <!--About Me-->
    <div id="about-me"><h1><em>About Me</em></h1>
    <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Born into an artistic family, I learned to love and cherish the creative  process from a very young age. My grandmother taught me how to sew and  crochet when I was little, so I started making dolls and toys for myself  and my brother and, later, for my own children, and I literally  couldn’t stop.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My  inspiration comes from my children, whom I watch as they play, laugh,  create, and grow, my family, nature, or it could just be a piece of  fabric. I put a lot of love and energy into my work and hope that this  will be felt by those families who welcome my dolls into their homes. <br></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Seeing  how abstract pieces of wool and cotton gradually shape themselves into a  doll with its own peculiar physical characteristics and personality  traits never fails to fill me with awe and excitement! <strong></strong><br></p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Thank you very much for visiting my website and appreciating my work!</p></div>
    




    <!--FAQ-->
    <div id="faq" class="faq"><h1>FAQ</h1>
    <br>
    <h2><em>What are the Petit Gosset Dolls made of?</em></h2>
    <p>Petit Gosset dolls begin their adventurous lives in my home studio, where I use the finest available materials to create dolls according to the traditional Waldorf method. Even though I use the same pattern, each doll comes out unique and has its own personality. Their skin is made from thick, 100%-cotton interlock from Switzerland, specially milled for dolls, and their bodies are firmly stuffed with premium eco-wool from Oregon. All the seams on their bodies are sewn twice for durability. Their eyes and lips, which I embroider with a cotton floss, immediately open up, and the mouth often begins to chatter, as I blush the new doll’s cheeks with a beeswax crayon. Petit Gosset dolls have diverse hair styles and lengths, and their hair is made with only natural fibers, such as wool yarn, hand-spun art yarn, mohair yarn (fluffy or curly), or wefted mohair. Each doll leaves my studio dressed according to the latest fashion, in clothes carefully designed, sewn, and knitted by me from high-end natural fabrics and fibers, such as Italian linen, silk, cotton batiste, cashmere and alpaca yarn.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><em>What are the Petit Gosset ready-to-go dolls sizes and prices?</em></h2>
    <br>
    <p>Each doll is one of a kind and requires more than 50 hours of work. Pricing depends on many factors (hair choice, facial features, materials and fashion styles). <br>
      Once in a while a ready-to-go-doll becomes available for sale. Please follow my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PetitGossetDolls/">Facebook page</a> for the updates. <br> 
    Petit Gosset dolls are intended for older children (7+) or adult collectors.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Have you been inspired to create a little friend yourself? I teach one-day and multi-day workshops, and all my workshops are custom designed to fit the needs and interests of each particular group or individual. <br>
    I host most workshops in either Westchester County, NY or Connecticut, but if you're interested in gathering together a group of doll-making friends, a workshop can also come your way! <br>
    Please feel free to contact me to discuss details at petitgosset@gmail.com. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Making a Natural Fiber Art Doll Workshop</strong>
    <br>

    Join me for an intensive 2-day workshop and learn the secrets of Waldorf-inspired doll making. <br>

    The class covers many doll-making techniques and design details. You will create a 13” doll and learn how to construct a head using rolling and needle-felting techniques, stuff the body with wool and attach body parts, add a belly button, knees, and a little bum, and finally, crochet a mohair wig. <br>
    All materials (including a doll pattern, pre-sewn body from beautiful Swiss skin fabric, sweet-smelling sheep wool and mohair for hair) are  provided. <br>

    Suitable for beginners in doll making but basic hand sewing and crochet skills are required. <br>

    Please note, the workshop does not cover doll clothing. <br>

    The workshop usually runs from 9.30 AM to 6.00 PM on both days. <br></p>
